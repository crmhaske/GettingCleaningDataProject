Code Book
==========

This code book describes what each of the variables and variable levels represent in the dttidy.txt and dttidymeans.txt data sets.

dttidy.txt and dttidymeans.txt
--------------------------------

subject:    An integer number between 1 and 30 for each subject that had their data recorded
            All subjects were volunteers and between the ages of 19 and 48 years

activity:   The activity taking place when the measurements were taken:
            - STANDING
            - SITTING
            - LAYING
            - WALKING
            - WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
            - WALKING_UPSTAIRS

feature:    The feature being measured.
            All features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1]:

            Freuqnecy domain signals
            Fast Fourier Transform of the time domain signals
            - fBodyAcc                
            - fBodyAccJerk            
            - fBodyAccMag             
            - fBodyAccJerkMag     
            - fBodyGyroJerkMag    
            - fBodyGyroMag     
            - fBodyGyro

            Time domain signals
            Captured at a constant rate of 50Hz
            3rd order low pass Butterworth filtered (corner frequency 20 Hz) to remove noise
            - tBodyAcc                
            - tBodyAccJerk            
            - tBodyAccJerkMag         
            - tBodyAccMag             
            - tBodyGyro               
            - tBodyGyroJerk           
            - tBodyGyroJerkMag        
            - tBodyGyroMag            
            - tGravityAcc             
            - tGravityAccMag          

            If the feature contains Acc it is an accelerometer measurement
            If the feature contains Gyro it is a gyroscope  measurement

            Accerlerometer Body and Gravity signals were separated using a low pass
            Butterworth filter (corner frequency 0.3 Hz)

            Jerk signals were obtained by deriving in time
            The magnitude (Mag) is the Euclidena norm of the Z, Y, and Z components

axis:	    If applicable: indicates whether the measurement was taken on the X, Y, or Z axis.
            If not applicable: NA


dttidy.txt only
----------------
record:     An integer number indicating the vector the feature measurements belong to.
            Used for the purpose of grouping vectors.
            There is no direct meaning of the value of the integer

mean:       The mean of the measured feature in the window (units vary by feature)

std:        The standard deviation of the measured feature window (units vary by feature)


dttidymeans.txt only
---------------------
avgMean:    The average of the means across all vectors
            Grouped by: subject, activity, feature, and axis

avgStd:     The average of the standard deviations across all vectors
            Grouped by: subject, activity, feature, and axis
