==========

This code book describes what each of the variables and variable levels represent in the dttidy.txt and dttidymeans.txt data sets.

dttidy.txt and dttidymeans.txt
--------------------------------

subject:    An integer number between 1 and 30 for each subject that had their data recorded
            All subjects were between the ages of 19 and 48 years

activity:   The activity taking place when the measurements were taken:
            - STANDING
            - SITTING
            - LAYING
            - WALKING
            - WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
            - WALKING_UPSTAIRS

feature:    The feature being measured.
            All features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1]:
            - fBodyAcc                accelerometer
            - fBodyAccJerk            accelerometer
            - fBodyAccMag             accelerometer
            - fBodyBodyAccJerkMag     accelerometer
            - fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag    gyroscope 
            - fBodyBodyGyroMag"       gyroscope 
            - fBodyGyro               gyroscope 
            - tBodyAcc                accelerometer
            - tBodyAccJerk            accelerometer
            - tBodyAccJerkMag         accelerometer
            - tBodyAccMag             accelerometer
            - tBodyGyro               gyroscope 
            - tBodyGyroJerk           gyroscope 
            - tBodyGyroJerkMag        gyroscope 
            - tBodyGyroMag            gyroscope 
            - tGravityAcc             accelerometer
            - tGravityAccMag          accelerometer

axis:	    If applicable: indicates whether the measurement was taken on the X, Y, or Z axis.
            If not applicable: NA
