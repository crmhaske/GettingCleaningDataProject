The files contained in this repository are in fulfillment of the project requirements for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera Course. All of the work contained in this repository is my own.

Files:
---

- codeBook.txt: Contains descriptions of all variables in the dttidy.txt and the dttidymeans.txt datafiles
- dttidy.txt: Tidy dataset containing the means and standard deviations of all features for all subjects (test and train datasets combined)
- dttidymeans.txt: Tidy dataset created in fulfillment of step 5 of the project instructions. Is comprised of the mean of the means and standard deviations grouped by subjects, activities, features, and axes
- run_analysis.R: the R script that uses the data as an input (must be in current working directory) and outputs the two tidy data sets described above
